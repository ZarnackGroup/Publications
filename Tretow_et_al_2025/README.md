# RNA G-quadruplexes and cooperative HNRNPH binding mediate switch-like splicing in cells and cancer patients

## Abstract

Alternative splicing, regulated by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), enables the generation of diverse transcript isoforms critical for cellular function. However, how RNA secondary structure impacts RBP binding and function remains poorly understood. Here, we unravel how RNA G-quadruplexes (rG4s) facilitate cooperativity in splicing regulation by the RBP heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H (HNRNPH). Through high-throughput in vivo and in vitro studies combined with theoretical modeling, we dissect how rG4s mediate cooperative HNRNPH binding to RNA, ultimately modulating the splicing of hundreds of exons. rG4 unfolding by HNRNPH exposes multiple G-rich binding sites, thereby establishing indirect cooperativity, which is further amplified to achieve switch-like splicing regulation. HNRNPH-mediated regulation is evident in breast cancer patients, where the resulting splicing patterns distinguish between tumor subtypes. Overall, our findings offer valuable insights into the mechanistic role of RNA secondary structures in cooperative RBP binding and splicing regulation and highlight the clinical relevance of HNRNPH-dependent splicing in cancer.
